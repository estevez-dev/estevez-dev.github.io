# Review

Choosing the new headphones was easy. After some research around youtube's reviews and comparisons, I ended up with two models: Sony WH-1000XM3 and Jabra Elite 85h. Hearing some comments about issues with Sony headphones after a recent firmware update and having a great experience with Jabra products in the past, I decided to go with the subject of today's post.

I need to say I'm more than happy with my choice. Let's start with the exterior. The fabric finish of the device makes it feels so good and unusual at the same time. It is harder to clean the fabric finish than the plastic one, but there are no visible finger marks even after a week of use on the fabric surface. It just looks always clean. I'm still wondering how it will look in a couple of months of continuous touching.

Having a touch-enabled surface on Soundcore Space NC with gesture recognition, I started to hate it. It is so modern and innovative, at first glance, but becomes so frustrating the more you use it. You can accidentally switch tracks, change volume level or hit play/pause while putting the headphones on your head or taking them down. That is why I'm happy to have physical buttons on Jabra.

Active noise cancellation (ANC) was one of the main features I cared about working from home. Because my wife works from home as well, and my daughter is at home in the afternoon. That could be a lot of noise, you can guess. ANC during the call is so good we can both with my wife be at different calls simultaneously in the same room. Working TV in the background will also be filtered out while on call. And you still can hear your voice during the call.
